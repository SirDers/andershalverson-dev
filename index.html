                        Built in Construct 3, which uses visual scripting structured similarly to JavaScript. I learned
                        the engine's ins and outs by creating a range of small systems and tests before starting this
                        project during my sophomore year of high school.

                    <p>
                        Before Quick Whips, I already enjoyed math and programming. I made simple projects in Scratch
                        and Java, and taught myself calculus, trigonometry, and basic discrete math concepts when I was
                        younger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I consider Quick Whips my first major project, since Construct 3 is a real game engine used in
                        shipped games. I spent a lot of time researching how it works and asking questions in the forums
                        and Discord server to gain a strong understanding of the engine.

                        Breath of the Galaxies is a 2D platformer inspired by the physics and gravity mechanics of Super
                        Mario Galaxy, developed in Construct 3. I designed and programmed the entire game solo during my
                        junior year of high school, focusing on smooth physics and responsive controls. Development
                        slowed toward the end due to the engine's limitations, but the project was a major step in
                        learning how to bring ambitious ideas to life within constraints.

                        Mario Maker, developed in JavaFX. I built it as my final project for Computer Science 2 to
                        demonstrate my understanding of JavaFX, choosing to challenge myself with a full platformer
                        rather than a typical GUI-based application. The game includes player movement, collisions,
                        enemies, level saving/loading, and tile-scrolling, all programmed from scratch.

                        v0.4.6 was the version I turned in for school (Dec, 2024). Since then, I've kept on updating the

                        Development course. Gardens of New Babylon focuses on forming patterns by managing resources and
                        strategically moving workers, set in a world inspired by the Hanging Gardens. I took on the
                        Designer role, leading the core mechanics and managing the team's workflow. The project involved
                        iterative playtesting, mechanic balancing, and creating a polished, playable prototype.

                        Currently leading and managing a team of 9 students (7 programmers and 2 artists) using Unity
                        and GitHub for version control. The original concept and design came from Morgan Richter, whose
                        pitch won the vote at the start of the semester. While I wasn't too involved in the design side,
                        I handled much of the technical work and made sure the game ran smoothly and stayed glitch-free.
                        So far, I've programmed Enemy AI, raycasting for better lighting and vision, and helping other
                        programmers through my understanding of past game development.

            <p>
                I'm Anders Halverson. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a
                concentration in Game Design and a minor in Mathematics at University of Wisconsin-Stout.
                My focus is on applying my programming, game design, and leadership skills to create innovative and fun
                video games everyone can enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm passionate and dedicated to self-learning, and have worked on several projects through my coursework
                and personal ambitions. Being at UW-Stout has taught me how to be a good leader and create
                high-functioning teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent my early childhood years in Tanzania. When living in Africa, I experienced other cultures,
                safaris, the Indian Ocean, and poverty. To add to my cultural awareness, I studied Databases in Ireland
                at the University of Limerick. For three years my parents adopted an Ethiopian teenager, which brought
                another culture into our household. Cross-cultural understanding has helped me manage diverse teams and
                enhanced my creative input with game design.
